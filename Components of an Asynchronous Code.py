"""In this lesson, we will learn about the components of the asynchronous code.

Write an Asynchronous Code#
To write asynchronous code in python, import the library using import asyncio.

Components#
Asyncio has 3 main components:

coroutines
event loop
future

Coroutine#
A coroutine is the result of an asynchronous function which can be declared using the keyword async before def.

1 async def my_function(argument):
2  pass

When we declare a function using the async keyword the function is not executed; instead, a coroutine object is returned.

To call a coroutine, write


1 my_coroutine = my_function(argument)

There are two ways to read the output of an async function from a coroutine. The first way is to use the await keyword, which is only possible inside async functions and will wait for the coroutine to terminate and return the result.

1 result = await my_function(argument)

The second way is to add it to an event loop.

Event Loop#
The event loop is the object which executes our asynchronous code and decides how to switch between async functions. After creating an event loop we can add multiple coroutines to it; these coroutines will all be running concurrently when run_until_complete or run_forever is called.

1 loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()  # create loop
2 future = loop.create_task(my_coroutine) # add coroutine to the loop
3 loop.run_until_complete(future) # add coroutine to the loop concurrently
4 loop.close() # close the loop


Future#
A future is an object that works as a placeholder for the output of an asynchronous function, and it gives us information about the function state. A future is created when we add a coroutine to an event loop. There are two ways to this:

future = loop.create_task(my_coroutine)


The method adds a coroutine to the loop and returns a task which is a subtype of the future.

Now that you have learned the components of asynchronous programming, letâ€™s move on to execute tasks using asynchronous programming."""
